                <center><img src = "assets/portal.png" alt = "" width = "150" height = "150"></center> <br>
                Web Mapping Portals provide a platform to view datasets in an interactive form, making it
                easier for users to investigate and analyse data. Portals can include additional tools such as:
                layer swipes, location lookup, print, data edits.

                <h2>Html File Data Viewers</h2>
                <center><img src = "assets/data-viewers.png" alt = "" width = "150" height = "150"></center> <br>
                A lightweight version of the Web Mapping Portals. These file data viewers display an interactive
                map for users to investigate and analyse data, without the need for desktop GIS software, whilst being bundled into a single file that is easy to
                share with others.
                <blockquote>&#x26A0 There are limits on the size of datasets displayed in the data viewers due to their lightweight structure. Farms, estates, and other small study areas are suitable for this output. Large study areas should consider the Web Mapping Portal option above.</blockquote>

                Alongside a standard pdf format, natural capital assessment reports can also be delivered
                in html format. Html reports appear similar to pdf reports, but have the benefit of interactive
                content, such as maps and data tables. This allows users to zoom, pan, and alter map layers all within the report
                file - providing improved viewing of datasets compared to a static image found in the pdf formats,
                and removing the need for desktop GIS software to view datasets.
